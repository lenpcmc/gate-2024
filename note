# halflife=28.8 years
# Age = 11.6 years
# Initial radioactivity = 0.1 microcuries 
# radioactivity remaining = 0.1*0.5^(11.67/28.8) microcuries = 0.0755 microcuries
# 1 Ci is equal to 37 billion (3.7 x 1010) disintegrations per second
# Each source emits 37.*10^9*0.0755*10^-6=2.7935*10^3 disintegrations per second

# Simulated integrated edep for known source = I (integrated energy)
# Experimental photon counting for known source = G (gamma)
# Our photons per MeV will be X=G/I
# Manufacturer provided phontons per MeV will be M
# conversion factor will be A=X/M 
# Count photons for desired material 
#Actual energy deposition = time * D *
